# Visual diagram of the construction

The construction that is described by the approach page will be represented again here, but using Mermaid or other diagrams to convey the construction relationships and/or message exchanges visually.

In some cases, the approach and diagram pages may be merged into a single page, but both aspects should exist in the end.
