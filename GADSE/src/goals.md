# Goals of this component exercise

Here we simply state what we will be achieving with this exercise

Example:

- Define the Traits of the component 
- Identify the hardware actions that fulfill these traits
- Define the HAL traits to match these hardware actions
- Implement the HAL traits to hardware access (or define mocks for a virtual example)
- Wrap this simple Traits implementation into a Device for service insertion
- Provide the service layer and insert the device into it
- Test the end result with unit tests and simple executions
- Update the project for an embedded build and deploy onto hardware.
