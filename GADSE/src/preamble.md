# Preamble / Pre-exercise content

This optional page may be a full subsection.
This is where other contributed documentation about the component or the subject should be inserted.
This content will provide an extended understanding of the component, and may even include an alternative
sample exercise within it.

Case in point - the recent mptf "Shelf 2" contribution for Thermal components.
