# Begin the component build for a std environment

We should be able to build the entire component and service stack in the local computer environment (std).
Whatever forced us to abandon this on our previous try was apparently a red-herring.
The new pattern should be to build the full working example as a standard build without the need for embedded
dependencies or target hardware, and then, once that is done, move on to an embedded context.

This page is simply the preamble that states this is what we are about to do for this component.
