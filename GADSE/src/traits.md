# Defining the component traits

The first step will be to define the component traits of our component.
This may include
- Associating an ODP repository that defines the traits for our component
- Discussing how these traits might be satisfied by hardware capabilities
- Discussing how a HAL trait class might be constructed to implement these capabilities
- Implementing these (in a mock way without HAL, since we don't expect real hardware here)
