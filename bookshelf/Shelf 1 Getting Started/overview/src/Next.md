## Beyond the introduction

You've learned about ODP and its role in modern firmware development.

You've coded some examples in Rust and have become familiar with embedded programming practices.

Our blinking light example gets things started and proves out the basic toolchain and coding practices.

Now you are ready for real-world examples.

You will find a collection of examples on 
Shelf 2 of the [ODP documentation library](../../library.html) that will help guide you as well.

Also check out [How To Build a Modern Laptop](../../2/how_to_build_a_modern_laptop/index.html) for how all of this is used to build a working virtual laptop.
