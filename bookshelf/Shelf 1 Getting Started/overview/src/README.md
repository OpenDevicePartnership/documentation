## Overview
An alliance of industry-leading PC ecosystem partners promoting secure, reusable, and trusted system software for client devices

The Open Device Partnership (ODP) is an open-source initiative focused on:
- Enhancing device security
- Simplifying cross-architecture development (ARM & x86 standards)
- Strengthening fundamentals (“raise all boats”)
- Accelerating the delivery of high-quality devices

Designed from the onset to be inclusive of all device ecosystem partners and stakeholders
- One stop location for everything needed to build a Windows client device
- Optimized for Windows devices but only successful if other operating systems can also thrive
- Open-source under the (MIT) with open governance focused on driving ecosystem innovation
- Long time-horizon investment (start by meeting partners where they are today)

## Projects
The following projects are currently in progress. As new areas are identified, they will be incorporated through the ODP governance process.
