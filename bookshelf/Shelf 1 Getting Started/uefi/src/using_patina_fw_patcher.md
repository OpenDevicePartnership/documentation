# Using the Patina FW Patcher
There is no need to rebuild everything with the Stuart build process each time you make a change in Rust.

The Patina-FW-Patcher is maintained in a repository of the same name: [patina-fw-patcher](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/patina-fw-patcher).  The README there has instructions for use.

There are a couple of ways to efficiently update the firmware build, depending upon the circumstances.
