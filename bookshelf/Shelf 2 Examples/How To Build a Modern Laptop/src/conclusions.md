# Summary and Takeaways

In conclusion, we recount what has been acheived in the course of this book.

In the end, the reader/developer now has a functional virtual laptop built on their desktop computer, and can now use this knowledge to build a real one using ODP.

Some content will be devoted to guides and caveats for those who will be branching from here into real hardware implementation.  This will probably be mostly in the form of external links to content written by others.

These steps, and their constituent references are summarized, and a section for additional external reading links is also included.
