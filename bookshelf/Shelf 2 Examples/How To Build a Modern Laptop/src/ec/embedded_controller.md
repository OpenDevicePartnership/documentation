# Embedded Controller
The Embedded Controller topic comes first, because this is where most of the modern features live and when we get to Patina, it will need to wait for this to be ready and then also connect to it for certain runtime operations.

Basic idea is to reference the Battery effort currently in place, and the soon to follow Charger and Thermal examples.  This should provide a pretty good blueprint for building a mock or real EC for these components and inspire the pattern for things not covered by the examples.
