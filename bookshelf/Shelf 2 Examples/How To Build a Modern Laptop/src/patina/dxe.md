# DXE
This will take the practical examples that follow on after the `test_component` work that was done in the samples and frame them in terms of implementation, including orchestration with the startup and readiness of the Embedded Controller.
These will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the examples currently underway or planned, such as Battery, Charger, Thermal. Human Interface Device (HID) components such as a keyboard implementation may be included as well.
