# Patina
This will discuss the building of the Patina boot code.  This will follow much the same path as the Patina introduction/test_component example and refer to the practical examples that come from that.

[Mermaid boot flow](...) a Mermaid boot flow diagram that shows the visual timeline of the DXE exchange with SEC and orchestration with the EC, the preparation of Runtime Services, and the boot loader startup of Windows and subsequent application-level interrogation of Runtime Services would be helpful here.
