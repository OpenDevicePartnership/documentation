# Runtime Services
This will implement the Patina Runtime Services integration with the EC components we have created there, so that we can check the battery status and other aspects of the EC services we have preiously implemented from the OS/application layer.

[Diagram TBD](...) a diagram that shows the Runtime Services and their interaction with Windows (EC_Services) may be useful here.
