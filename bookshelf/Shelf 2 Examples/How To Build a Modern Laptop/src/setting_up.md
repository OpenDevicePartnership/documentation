# Setting Up

This discusses the tooling that is needed for this endeavor, which is covered in the tutorial sections and referenced for detail, but checklist-style steps are provided here to insure both the novice and experienced developer are on the same footing before continuing with the build.  This includes references to the introductory prerequisites for Rust, and also covers embedded tooling, debugging, and use of MS Code as a common IDE choice.

A visual matrix of required tools and versions would be useful here.
