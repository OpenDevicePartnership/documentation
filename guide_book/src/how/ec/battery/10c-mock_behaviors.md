## Mocking Battery Behavior
We now have the component parts of our battery subsystem assembled and it is ready to process the messages it receives at the event handler.

### Handling the messages

For right now, we are going to continue to make use of our `println!` output in our std context to show us the data our battery
produces in response to the messages it receives.

Update the event handler so that we print what we get for `PollStaticData`:
```rust
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn event_handler_task(
    mut controller: &'static mut OurController,
    channel: &'static mut BatteryChannel
) {
    use battery_service::context::BatteryEventInner;

    println!("🛠️  Starting event handler...");


    loop {
        let event = channel.receive().await;
        println!("🔔 event_handler_task received event: {:?}", event);
        match event.event {
            BatteryEventInner::PollStaticData => {
                println!("🔄 Handling PollStaticData");
                let sd  = controller.get_static_data(). await;
                println!("📊 Static battery data: {:?}", sd);
            }
            BatteryEventInner::PollDynamicData => {
                println!("🔄 Handling PollDynamicData");

            }
            BatteryEventInner::DoInit => {
                println!("⚙️  Handling DoInit");
            }
            BatteryEventInner::Oem(code, data) => {
                println!("🧩 Handling OEM command: code = {code}, data = {:?}", data);
            }
            BatteryEventInner::Timeout => {
                println!("⏰ Timeout event received");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
and add this import near the top:
```rust
use battery_service::controller::Controller;
```
so that we can reach the `Controller` methods of our controller.

Note that in an actual battery implementation, it is common to cache this static data after the first fetch to avoid the 
overhead of interrogating the hardware for this unchanging data each time. We are not doing that here, as it would be superfluous to our virtual implementation.

Output now should look like:

```
⏳ Waiting for BATTERY_FUEL_READY signal...
🔌 Initializing battery fuel gauge service...
🔋 Launching battery service (single-threaded)
🧩 Registering battery device...
✅🔋 Battery service is up and running.

```

We can see the data is all zeroes.

___But wait! Didn't we create our `VirtualBatteryState` with meaningful values and implement `MockBattery` to use it?___

Yes.  We did.  And we made sure our `MockBatteryController` forwarded all of its `SmartBattery` traits to its inner battery.
But we did not implement our `Controller` traits for this with anything other than default (0) values.

### Implementing `get_static_data` at the `MockBatteryController`

If we look at `mock_battery_controller.rs` we see the existing code for `get_static_data` is simply:

```rust
    async fn get_static_data(&mut self) -> Result<StaticBatteryMsgs, Self::ControllerError> {
        Ok(StaticBatteryMsgs { ..Default::default() })
    }
```

The `StaticBatteryMsgs` structure is made up of series of named data elements:
```rust
    pub manufacturer_name: [u8; 21],
    pub device_name: [u8; 21],
    pub device_chemistry: [u8; 5],
    pub design_capacity_mwh: u32,
    pub design_voltage_mv: u16,
```
that we must fill from the data available from the battery.

So, replace the stub for `get_static_data` in `mock_battery_controller.rs` with this working version:
            
```rust
    async fn get_static_data(&mut self) -> Result<StaticBatteryMsgs, Self::ControllerError> {
        let mut name = [0u8; 21];
        let mut device = [0u8; 21];
        let mut chem = [0u8; 5];

        println!("MockBatteryController: Fetching static data");

        self.battery.manufacturer_name(&mut name).await?;
        self.battery.device_name(&mut device).await?;
        self.battery.device_chemistry(&mut chem).await?;

        let capacity = match self.battery.design_capacity().await? {
            CapacityModeValue::MilliAmpUnsigned(v) => v,
            _ => 0,
        };

        let voltage = self.battery.design_voltage().await?;

        // This is a placeholder, replace with actual logic to determine chemistry ID
        // For example, you might have a mapping of chemistry names to IDs       
        let chem_id = [0x01, 0x02]; // example
        
        // Serial number is a 16-bit value, split into 4 bytes
        // where the first two bytes are zero   
        let raw = self.battery.serial_number().await?;
        let serial = [0, 0, (raw >> 8) as u8, (raw & 0xFF) as u8];

        Ok(StaticBatteryMsgs {
            manufacturer_name: name,
            device_name: device,
            device_chemistry: chem,
            design_capacity_mwh: capacity as u32,
            design_voltage_mv: voltage,
            device_chemistry_id: chem_id,
            serial_num: serial,
        })
    }    
```

Now when we run, we should see our MockBattery data represented:

```
⏳ Waiting for BATTERY_FUEL_READY signal...
🔌 Initializing battery fuel gauge service...
🔋 Launching battery service (single-threaded)
🧩 Registering battery device...
✅🔋 Battery service is up and running.
🔔 BATTERY_FUEL_READY signaled
🛠️  Starting event handler...
✍ Sending test BatteryEvent...
✅ Test BatteryEvent sent
🔔 event_handler_task received event: BatteryEvent { event: PollStaticData, device_id: DeviceId(1) }
🔄 Handling PollStaticData
MockBatteryController: Fetching static data
📊 Static battery data: Ok(StaticBatteryMsgs { manufacturer_name: [77, 111, 99, 107, 66, 97, 116, 116, 101, 114, 121, 67, 111, 114, 112, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], device_name: [77, 66, 45, 52, 50, 48, 48, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], device_chemistry: [76, 73, 79, 78, 0], design_capacity_mwh: 5000, design_voltage_mv: 7800, device_chemistry_id: [1, 2], serial_num: [0, 0, 1, 2] })
```

So, very good. Crude, but effective. Now we can do essentially the same thing for `get_dynamic_data`.

First, let's issue the `PollDynamicData` message.  This is just temporary, so just add this to the bottom of your
existing `test_message_sender` task:

```rust
    // now for the dynamic data:
    let event2 = BatteryEvent {
        device_id: DeviceId(1),
        event: BatteryEventInner::PollDynamicData,
    };

    if let Err(e) = svc.endpoint.send(
        EndpointID::Internal(embedded_services::comms::Internal::Battery),
        &event2,
    ).await {
        println!("❌ Failed to send test BatteryEvent: {:?}", e);
    } else {
        println!("✅ Test BatteryEvent sent");
    }
```

and in the `event_handler_task`:

```rust
    BatteryEventInner::PollDynamicData => {
        println!("🔄 Handling PollDynamicData");
        let dd  = controller.get_dynamic_data().await;
        println!("📊 Dynamic battery data: {:?}", dd);
    }
```
will suffice for a quick report.

Now, implement into `mock_battery_controller.rs` in the `Controller` implementation for `get_dynamic_data` as this:

```rust

    async fn get_dynamic_data(&mut self) -> Result<DynamicBatteryMsgs, Self::ControllerError> {
        println!("MockBatteryController: Fetching dynamic data");

        // Pull values from SmartBattery trait
        let full_capacity = match self.battery.full_charge_capacity().await? {
            CapacityModeValue::MilliAmpUnsigned(val) => val as u32,
            _ => 0,
        };

        let remaining_capacity = match self.battery.remaining_capacity().await? {
            CapacityModeValue::MilliAmpUnsigned(val) => val as u32,
            _ => 0,
        };

        let battery_status = {
            let status = self.battery.battery_status().await?;
            // Bit masking matches the SMS specification
            let mut result: u16 = 0;
            result |= (status.fully_discharged() as u16) << 0;
            result |= (status.fully_charged() as u16) << 1;
            result |= (status.discharging() as u16) << 2;
            result |= (status.initialized() as u16) << 3;
            result |= (status.remaining_time_alarm() as u16) << 4;
            result |= (status.remaining_capacity_alarm() as u16) << 5;
            result |= (status.terminate_discharge_alarm() as u16) << 7;
            result |= (status.over_temp_alarm() as u16) << 8;
            result |= (status.terminate_charge_alarm() as u16) << 10;
            result |= (status.over_charged_alarm() as u16) << 11;
            result |= (status.error_code() as u16) << 12;
            result
        };

        let relative_soc_pct = self.battery.relative_state_of_charge().await? as u16;
        let cycle_count = self.battery.cycle_count().await?;
        let voltage_mv = self.battery.voltage().await?;
        let max_error_pct = self.battery.max_error().await? as u16;
        let charging_voltage_mv = 0; // no charger implemented yet
        let charging_current_ma = 0; // no charger implemented yet
        let battery_temp_dk = self.battery.temperature().await?;
        let current_ma = self.battery.current().await?;
        let average_current_ma = self.battery.average_current().await?;

        // For now, placeholder sustained/max power
        let max_power_mw = 0;
        let sus_power_mw = 0;

        Ok(DynamicBatteryMsgs {
            max_power_mw,
            sus_power_mw,
            full_charge_capacity_mwh: full_capacity,
            remaining_capacity_mwh: remaining_capacity,
            relative_soc_pct,
            cycle_count,
            voltage_mv,
            max_error_pct,
            battery_status,
            charging_voltage_mv,
            charging_current_ma,
            battery_temp_dk,
            current_ma,
            average_current_ma,
        })
    }        
```
You can see that this is similar to what was done for `get_static_data`.

Now run and you will see representative values that come from your current `MockBattery`/`VirtualBatteryState` implementation:

```
🔄 Handling PollDynamicData
MockBatteryController: Fetching dynamic data
📊 Dynamic battery data: Ok(DynamicBatteryMsgs { max_power_mw: 0, sus_power_mw: 0, full_charge_capacity_mwh: 4800, remaining_capacity_mwh: 4800, relative_soc_pct: 100, cycle_count: 0, voltage_mv: 4200, max_error_pct: 1, battery_status: 0, charging_voltage_mv: 0, charging_current_ma: 0, battery_temp_dk: 2982, current_ma: 0, average_current_ma: 0 })
```

## Starting a simulation

So now we can see the values of tha battery, but our virtual battery does not experience time naturally, so we need to 
advance it along its way to observe its simulated behaviors.

You no doubt recall the `tick()` function in `virtual_battery.rs` that performs all of our virtual battery simulation actions.

We now will create a new task in `main.rs` to spawn to advance time for our battery.

Add this task at the bottom of `main.rs`: 

```rust
#[embassy_executor::task]
async fn simulation_task(
    battery: &'static MockBattery,
    multiplier: f32
) {
    loop {
        {
            let mut state = battery.state.lock().await;
            
            // Simulate current draw (e.g., discharge at 1200 mA)
            state.set_current(-1200);
            
            // Advance the simulation by one tick
            println!("calling tick...");
            state.tick(0, multiplier);
        }

        // Simulate once per second
        Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    }
}
```
and near the top, add these imports:

```rust
use mock_battery::mock_battery::MockBattery;
use embassy_time::{Timer, Duration};

```

This task takes passed-in references to the battery and also a 'multiplier' that determines how fast the simulation runs (effectively the number of seconds computed for the tick operation)

So let's call that in our `spawn` block with

```rust
    spawner.spawn(simulation_task(inner_battery_for_sim, 10.0)).unwrap();
```
creating the `inner_battery_for_sim` value as another copy of `inner_battery` in the section above:
```rust
    let inner_battery_for_sim = duplicate_static_mut!(inner_battery, MockBattery);
```
      
Now we want to look at the dynamic values of the battery over time.  To continue our crude but effective `println!` output
for this, let's modify our `test_message_sender` again, this time wrapping the existing call to issue the `PollDynamicData` message in a loop that repeats every few seconds:

```rust
    loop {
            // now for the dynamic data:
            let event2 = BatteryEvent {
                device_id: DeviceId(1),
                event: BatteryEventInner::PollDynamicData,
            };

            if let Err(e) = svc.endpoint.send(
                EndpointID::Internal(embedded_services::comms::Internal::Battery),
                &event2,
            ).await {
                println!("❌ Failed to send test BatteryEvent: {:?}", e);
            } else {
                println!("✅ Test BatteryEvent sent");
            }

            embassy_time::Timer::after(embassy_time::Duration::from_millis(3000)).await;
        }
```

When you run now, you will see repeated outputs of the dynamic data and you will note the values changing as the
simulation (running at 10x speed) shows the effect of a 1200 ma current draw over time.

Note the relative_soc_pct slowing decreasing from 100% in pace with the remaining_capacity_mwh value, the voltage slowly decaying, and the temperature increasing.

While this simulation with the `println!` outputs have been helpful in building a viable battery simulator that could fit into the component model of an embedded controller integration, it is not a true substitute for actual unit tests, so we
will do that next.
