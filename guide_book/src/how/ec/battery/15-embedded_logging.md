# Embedded logging support

We will need to verify our embedded build runs, and to do that we need to insure we have logging properly implemented.
This covers that effort (if not already in place from the previous steps), and the usages of logging in the embedded context.
Also covers panic handling, as a reminder and in keeping with how failures are reported in logging.
