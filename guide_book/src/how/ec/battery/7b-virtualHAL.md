# A Virtual Battery

It bears repeating that the outcome of this exercise will be a _virtual_ battery, and not an attachment to real battery hardware.

We are going to construct a virtual battery simulator in this step, but this is a good time to note what we would be doing instead if we were working with real battery hardware at this point.

## The Virtual Battery state machine

Instead of a HAL layer, we will construct a battery that operates entirely through software.
This will be a state machine with functions to compute values and simulate behavior over time that is consistent with its real-world counterpart.

This may not be the most sophisticated or comprehensive battery simulator one could construct, but it will be more than sufficient for our purposes.

### Understanding the virtual battery

What we've done here is to define a virtual battery as a set of states. These coincide with the values we will need from the `MockBattery` to satisfy the `SmartBattery` traits. 

We initialize our virtual battery with some constant starting values, and include a reset function that sets the values back to
a fully charged, idle state.  We offer some helper functions to return some of the dynamic value computations and to relay
constant string values.

Of most interest, however, is perhaps the `tick()` function that controls the simulation.

Here, the caller passes in a `multiplier` value to control how fast the simulation runs (1x == 1 simulated second per tick).
From this delta, the effects of current draw or charge on the battery reserves and its temperature are computed and
the corresponding states are updated.

### Add to lib.rs
We need to make this `virtual_battery` module visible to the rest of the project, so add it to your `lib.rs` file as so:

```rust
pub mod mock_battery;
pub mod virtual_battery;
```

## Attaching to MockBattery

Now we are going to attach our virtual battery to our `MockBattery` construction so that it can implement the `SmartBattery` traits by calling upon our `VirtualBatteryState`.

Edit your `mock_battery.rs` file.  

At the top, add these imports:

```rust
use crate::virtual_battery::VirtualBatteryState;
use embassy_sync::blocking_mutex::raw::ThreadModeRawMutex;
use embassy_sync::mutex::Mutex;
```
This will give us access to our virtual battery construction and supply the necessary thread-safe wrappers we will need to access it.

We need to update our `MockBattery` to accommodate an inner `VirtualBatteryState` property.  
Replace the line that currently reads
```rust
pub struct MockBattery;
```
With this block of code instead:
```rust
pub struct MockBattery {
    pub state: Arc<Mutex<ThreadModeRawMutex, VirtualBatteryState>>,
}

impl MockBattery {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            state: Arc::new(Mutex::new(VirtualBatteryState::new_default())),
        }
    }
}

```
Now we can proceed to replace the current placeholder implementations of the `SmartBattery` traits.

To do this, we will be changing the function signature patterns from `async fn function_name(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self:Error>` to `fn function_name(&mut self) -> impl Future<Output = Result<(), Self::Error>>`

This is in fact a valid replacement that satisfies the trait requirement because although we are not implementing an async function, we are implementing one that returns a `Future`, which amounts to the same thing.  But it is necessary to do here because we are capturing shared state behind a mutex, which introduces constraints that conflict with the way `async fn` in trait implementations is normally handled. By returning a `Future` explicitly and using an `async move` block, we gain the flexibility needed to safely lock and use that shared state within the method, while still satisfying the trait.

> **Why can't we just use `async fn`?**
>
> While the `SmartBattery` trait defines its methods using `async fn`, and our earlier implementation used that form successfully, it no longer works once we introduce shared mutable state behind a `Mutex`. Here's why:
>
> - `async fn` in a trait impl "de-sugars" to a fixed, compiler-generated Future type.
> - This future type must be safely transferrable and nameable in the trait system.
> - When the body of the `async fn` captures a value like `self.state.lock().await`, it may no longer satisfy required bounds like `Send`.
> - This is especially true when using `embassy_sync::Mutex`, which is designed for embedded systems and is **not `Send`**.
> - As a result, the compiler refuses the `async fn` because it cannot produce a compatible future that satisfies the trait's expectations.
>
> ✅ The solution is to return a `Future` explicitly:
>
> - This allows us to construct the future manually using an `async move` block.
> - We can safely capture non-`Send` values inside this block (such as a mutex guard).
> - It also avoids lifetime or type inference issues that might arise from compiler-generated future types in trait contexts.
>
> This pattern is not only more flexible but necessary whenever your async code interacts with embedded, single-threaded, or non-`Send` systems—like those commonly used with `no_std` or simulated devices.


With this in mind, we can then implement calls into our `VirtualBatteryState` by following a pattern such as the one exhibited here:
```rust
    fn voltage(&mut self) -> impl Future<Output = Result<u16, Self::Error>> {
        let state = &self.state;
        async move {
            let lock = state.lock().await;
            Ok(lock.voltage_mv)
        }            
    }
```
Where we obtain access to our `VirtualBatteryState` property and then use `async move` to obtain a mutex lock for thread safety, and then return the value from the locked state as a Result.    


### A completed integration 

When we repeat that pattern of integration for each of the `SmartBattery` traits, the end result looks like this:

```rust

Note above that `charging_current` and `charging_voltage` are simple placeholders that return 0 values for now.  The Charger is a separate component addition that we will deal with in the next section.  There is no underlying virtual battery support for this, so we will be without a charger for the time being.

### Cargo.toml additions
We also need to update our `Cargo.toml` files.  In `mock_battery/Cargo.toml`, add the following to your `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
embassy-sync = { workspace = true, features=["std"] }
critical-section = {version = "1.0", features = ["std"] }
async-trait = "0.1"
```

and in your top-level `Cargo.toml` (`battery_project/Cargo.toml`), add this:
```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
embassy-sync = "0.7.0"
```

## Now to expose this to the service

We have defined the battery traits and their behaviors in `virtual_battery.rs` and implemented these as the `SmartBattery` traits exposed by `mock_battery.rs`

Our `virtual_battery.rs` serves as a software-only replacement for what would be a HAL implementation, with the difference being that state values would be drawn from the actual hardware circuitry, per manufacturer design (i.e. GPIO or MMIO), and helper functions to align these to SBS compliant concepts would be created instead, and of course, there would be no "simulation" function needed in a real-world design.

But before any of what we've created is useful, it needs to be exposed to the service layer.  In the next step, we'll do a simple test that shows we can expose these values, and then we'll start the processes to implement the service layer that conveys these up the chain in response to service messages.
