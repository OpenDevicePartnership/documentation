# Battery + Charger Summary

In this section, we built a complete `Battery` + `Charger` component set, validating their interactions in a functioning Battery Subsystem through both unit and integration tests.

## What We Did

In the process, we established key patterns that will carry forward into similar subsystems:

- **Component Architecture**  
  - Explored the roles of the *Component*, *HAL layer*, *Device*, and *Controller*.
  - Used *Generic Types* to enable dependency injection and flexible implementation choices.
  - Registered the `Device` to introduce a new subsystem into the runtime.

- **Event-Driven Behavior**  
  - Defined and handled `BatteryEvent` messages via the `Controller` to enact behavior.

- **Asynchronous Integration**  
  - Adapted async tasks using `embassy::executor` and `#[embassy_executor::task]` to run under both `std` (for development and testing) and embedded (no-std) environments.

- **Testing Support**  
  - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for the Battery and Charger subsystems.
  - Added integration tests to verify runtime behavior across components.

## What We Didn't Do

This exercise focused on illustrating patternsâ€”not delivering production-grade code. Accordingly:

- We did **not** fully implement the `Smart Battery` specification.  
  Features such as removable batteries, dynamic BatteryMode handling, or full status reporting were omitted for simplicity.

- Our **simulations** of battery behavior and charger policy were intentionally lightweight.  
  The goal was to simulate dynamic behavior, not to mirror real-world electrical characteristics.

- **Error handling** was minimal.  
  A real embedded system would avoid `panic!()` in favor of structured error recovery and system notification. Here, we favored visibility and simplicity.
