# Embedded Controller Components

The Embedded Controller orchestrates a number of individual Device Components.  Each component is tailored to meet a given subservice feature that is defined by traits.  A Device signature that fulfills these traits can be injected as a component into the system in a modular way.

In the following exercises we will build a few such components -- Battery, Charger, and Thermal -- and learn the patterns for constructing and testing Embedded Controller components that are ready for embedded targeting and integration.
