# Embedded Controller Components

_TODO_

We start out the building exercises with a series of simple EC components. 

Basic idea is to reference the Battery effort currently in place, and the soon to follow Charger and Thermal examples.  This should provide a pretty good blueprint for building a mock or real EC for these components and inspire the pattern for things not covered by the examples.
