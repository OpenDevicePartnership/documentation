# Integration  Tests

In building our Battery, Charger, and Thermal components, we created unit tests to verify each of those individually, and although we touched upon integration testing slightly, we haven't done any component integration or testing yet.  

Here we shall begin the process of bringing each of our component projects together in one build and integrating them into a service structure where they will all work together.

We will create a TDD style set of integration tests that will help guide us through the integration and the verification of the behaviors.

When the integration is complete, it will be ready to put onto a hardware target.
