# Microsoft Power Thermal Framework Getting Started
This section covers details from integration with the OS through EC services down to the MCU code that controls system thermals.

The Microsoft Power Thermal Framework (MPTF) specification is not defined here. A good understanding of what MPTF is and how the OS interacts with it should be considered first to properly understand this getting started guide.

By the end of this guide you should be able to take your hardware platform running windows and use it to control fan and thermal attributes from your embedded controller.

## A discussion before we begin
This section is _not_ the Thermal Component Example.  That discussion will follow.  This section is meant to provide real-world context for a specific implementation of the thermal component subsystem as it relates to the MPTF specification.
