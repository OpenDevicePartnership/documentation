# Setting up Development

If you are planning on going through these exercises to get a handle on developing components for Patina or the Embedded Controller, you will not need anything more than the Rust toolchain and development tools already described.  You can
build each of the exercises to construct a component in a non-embedded (std) environment and test on your local machine.

However, if you are planning on building for the virtual laptop project, you will need to set up QEMU as the host for the Patina boot firmware, and for EC Components, you will need a development board where you will target your embedded code to run on as a makeshift Embedded Controller.
