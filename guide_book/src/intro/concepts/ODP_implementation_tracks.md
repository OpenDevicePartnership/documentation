# ODP Implementation tracks

The patterns, specifications, and reference code that comprise the Open Device Partnership offering covers the full gamut of system firmware creation, but typically boils down to one of three main scopes:

| Boot Firmware (Patina) | Embedded Controllers | Embedded Controller Services 
| ---------------------- |--------------------- |--------------------
![Boot Firmware](./images/boot.png) | ![Embedded Controller](./images/ec_mcu.png) | ![EC Services](./images/ec_services.png)

These scopes may be implemented in a secure or a non-secure foundation
and communicate over a variety of suitable data transports
