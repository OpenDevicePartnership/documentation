# Getting Started with ODP

![Choose Your Path](./media/choose_path.png)

## Welcome to the Open Device Partnership (ODP)!

ODP is a community-driven framework for building **secure**, **modular**, and **reusable** firmware components across a range of systems. Whether you’re interested in low-level boot firmware, embedded controller services, or integrating a complete firmware stack, ODP has something for you.

## What is ODP?

ODP brings modern software engineering practices—like memory safety and dependency injection—to the world of firmware. It leverages Rust to improve confidence, maintainability, and modularity across diverse hardware and system designs.

It also embraces existing standards like UEFI, DICE, ACPI, and EC protocols—but makes them more accessible and safer to implement.

## Need to Learn Rust?

ODP uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to provide memory safety and modern tooling. If you're new to it, don’t worry—we provide a [Quick Look at Rust](./intro/concepts/rust_quick_look.md) to help you get oriented.
