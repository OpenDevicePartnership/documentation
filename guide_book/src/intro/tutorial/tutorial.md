# Tutorial

#### _Ready to go hands-on?_

Later in this book we will be writing real embedded code for real hardware, using one of many easily sourced and affordable development boards, such as the [STM32F3Discovery Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html), which is used in the Rust Embedded Book and is suitable for the exercises we will conduct here.

If you have a different development board, that's fine -- the examples are not really tied to any particular piece of  hardware, and only minor adjustments may be needed to adapt the instructions here to different hardware.

If you are new to embedded programming in Rust, you may find the guide and excercises in the 
[Rust Embedded Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/embedded-book/start) to be a great introduction.

Once we have learned the basic principles of how to use the Rust language in an embedded environment, and have set up the tooling, we are ready to move into the ODP framework to structure our designs.

Continue your journey with the [Discovery board](./tutorial/Discovery.md), which bridges familiar embedded projects and EC-style service structure.

#### ___Not__ ready to go hands-on?_
That's okay -- but you might want to look through this quick tutorial anyway because it contains key examples of the ODP construction patterns in practice.
