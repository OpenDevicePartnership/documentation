# Open Device Partnership documentation guide

The purpose of this document is to guide you through an understanding of ODP regardless of where you are starting from or where your interest may lie.

The overall ODP umbrella is quite large and encompassing, and can be tricky to navigate through, so we will try to simplify that journey a little as well as giving direction on which path along the journey might best fit your interest or involvmement.

This document will briefly review the value proposition of ODP and why it is the right technology for the future of firmware development, at the right time.

Then the different 'tracks' of ODP will be explained.  Here, you may find you are interested in only one of these tracks, or you may find you want to learn more about all of them.

Then, what is inside ODP and where to find it is detailed further - this is a good resource for those simply wishing to navigate the maze of contributed repositories that are available and which ones fit together for a given task.

Finally, for developers wishing to know more about how all of this comes together, a series of example implementation exercises are detailed. These can be explored in themselves or toward the end of the example's goal to create a complete virtual laptop that integrates the product of each of the individual exercises into a practical working end result.

You are in control of how you navigate through this guide, whether you proceed through it all one step at a time, or jump into the paths you find most compelling to your interest is entirely up to you.
