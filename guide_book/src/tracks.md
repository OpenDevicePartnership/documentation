# The tracks of ODP

ODP is a comprehensive umbrella addressing a span of firmware concerns:

- Boot Firmware / UEFI  (Patina)
- Embedded Controller components and services (EC)
- Security firmware and architecture

Development efforts for these domains are often not performed by the same teams, and these pieces are often built independently of each other and only brought together in the end.

ODP does not usurp this development paradigm but rather empowers it further through the commonality of the Rust language and tools, and through a shared philosophy of modularity and agility.


## How to continue with this book

This book is geared to a couple of different distinct audiences.  If you are concerned primarily with any one of the particular 'tracks' of ODP and are interested in a guide to which ODP repositories are relevant for that track, continue with [What is in ODP?](./what/what.md)

If you are interested in examples of _how_ to develop along any of these tracks, follow the examples in [Building a Virtual Laptop](./laptop/laptop.md), either those relevant to the topic of your interest alone, or follow the entire exercise to build a complete virtual laptop comprised of each of these elements.
