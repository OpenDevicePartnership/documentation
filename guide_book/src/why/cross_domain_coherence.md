# Cross-Domain Coherence

ODP is not just a patch atop of old layers.  It is explicitly aligning system layers to reduce duplication, ambiguity, and failure points.

ODP is not just a firmware stack, but a vision that unites the embedded controller, main firmware, and even secure services under a coherent design and tooling approach.

## Common patterns with clearly defined lanes

Shared services and conventions allow clear division of responsibility between firmware, EC, and OSâ€”while promoting reuse and coordination.
