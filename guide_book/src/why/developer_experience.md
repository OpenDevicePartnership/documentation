# Improved Developer Experience

ODP reduces developer friction and increases confidence, thus shortening the time to value for the development effort.

Developers can build and test components in isolation (e.g., battery, GPIO, boot timer), aided by QEMU emulation, mocks, and test harnesses.

With tools like patina-fw-patcher, even embedded iterations feel fast and accessible â€” no need to flash hardware with each development change.

The Rust ecosystem brings built-in unit testing, logging, dependency control (Cargo), and static analysis.
