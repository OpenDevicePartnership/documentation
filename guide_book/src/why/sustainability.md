# Sustainability and Long-Term Cost Reduction

ODP can help cut tech debt at its root by investing in sustainable design by enabling leaner teams and cleaner codebases.

## Build right and reuse
Replacing legacy code with safer, testable, and reusable modules means lower maintenance costs over time.

### HAL separation
The ability to reuse and recompose across product lines (via ODP libraries) reduces the need to "reinvent the wheel" for each board/platform, as Hardware Abstraction Layers can be cleanly isolated from the business logic of a component design, and easily expanded upon for new features.
