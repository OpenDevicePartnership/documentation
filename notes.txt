TODO Reminders:
----------------------

Later in the battery project, change the panic in fuel gauge registration
to 
if let Err(e) = reg {
    error!("Fuel gauge registration failed: {:?}", e);
    return;
}
so it can handle (e.g.) a removable battery

GADSE notes:
The GADSE template is a format for how to frame each component project.
It is flexible in that each page could expand into a section or merge and collapse into a previous page, but
the overall structure of concept communication should be kept the same for each component implementation deep-dive

-------------------
Final integration:
In the end there will need to be a significant section on the final integration of all the pieces into the 'virtual laptop',
but that is not currently represented in the existing guide layout. It will need to be added.

No longer possible?

### Redirecting log output
You may recall that when we did our first test run using the default `.efi` location that the runtime debug log output was output to the console and was too lengthy to see the top portion of. We can redirect the output to go to a file instead, which will allow us to see everything as well as keeping it in a place we can review after each run.

Edit the file `Platforms\QemuQ35Pkg\Plugins\QemuRunner.py` and look for a line that says  `args = "-debugcon stdio"` (about line 66) and change this to read `args = "-debugcon file:debug.log"`.  This will redirect log output to a file "debug.log" in your Z:\ location when run.

Now, still at the Z:\ prompt (activated), type
```
stuart_build -c Platforms\QemuQ35Pkg/PlatformBuild.py --FlashRom
```
Again, this will take several minutes and cover a few phases with lots of console output.
Finally, the QEMU window will appear, display it's splash graphic, identifying text, and shell prompt.  

You will find your Z:\debug.log file now populated and containing the run output.

Verify this is from your local build by checking this log.
You should see the log line 
```
INFO - DXE Core Platform Binary v0.3.2
```
around about line 900 - 910 or so
_note version number may be different_

This log line is emitted from the `bin/q35_dxe_core.rs` file of the patina-dxe-core-qemu sources, which is the launch point for the components.

We will create and install our own component in the next exercise.
