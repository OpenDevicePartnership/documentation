## Contribution Workflow
Contributions to an ODP repository should start with a fork of the repository into a downstream repository under the contributor's GitHub account. This allows the contributor to make changes without affecting the upstream repository until the changes are ready to be merged. The typical workflow is as follows:
1. 🍴 **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the repository.
2. 💻 **Clone the Fork**: Download your forked repository to your machine.   
3. 🌿 **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes to keep changes isolated and organized.
4. 🔄 **Sync with Upstream**:Stay up to date with the main project.
5. ✍️ **Make Changes**: Code, docs, or other contributions.
6. 🧾 **Commit Changes**:  Use clear, meaningful commit messages.
7. 🚀 **Push Changes**: Send changes to your GitHub fork.
8. 📬 **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request (PR) upstream to propose your changes.
