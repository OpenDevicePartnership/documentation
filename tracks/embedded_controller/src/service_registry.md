# Embedded Controller Service Registration

Embedded Controller components and services in ODP are statically composed at build time but must be registered with the **service infrastructure** to become discoverable and operational during execution.

This registration model allows each **policy domain** (e.g. power, thermal, charging) to **own and manage the devices** associated with it.

---

## Registration Pattern

The `embedded_services` crate defines the services and their policy managers. A typical registration pattern looks like this:

```rust
let battery = BATTERY.init(BatteryDevice::new(...));
let controller = BatteryController::new(battery.clone());

SERVICE_REGISTRY.register(controller);
```

- `BATTERY` is a `StaticCell` (or similar allocation) initialized at startup.

- `BatteryDevice` wraps the actual component (e.g., a `MockBattery`) and implements required traits.

- `BatteryController` implements the `Service` trait and delegates operations to the device.

- `SERVICE_REGISTRY` stores the controller and makes it accessible to both the async executor and message routing infrastructure.

### What Registration Enables
| Feature | Enabled by Registration |
|---------|------------------------|
| Message Routing | The `comms` system delivers events to services |
| Task Spawning | Services are polled and run by the executor |
| Feature Exposure | Subfeatures (e.g. _fuel_gauge_) declared via trait contracts |
| Test Visibility | Services and devices can be observed in tests |

## Message Dispatch and Service Binding
Once a controller is registered, the service registry allows the comms system to route incoming events to the correct service based on:
- The __device ID__
- The __message type__
- The controller's implementation of the `handle()` function (_as defined by Service_)

When a message is emitted (e.g. `BatteryEvent::UpdateStatus`), the comms channel looks up the appropriate service and dispatches the message.

```rust
impl Service for BatteryController {
    async fn handle(&mut self, msg: Message) -> Result<()> {
        match msg {
            Message::Battery(BatteryEvent::UpdateStatus) => {
                self.device.update().await
            }
            _ => Ok(()),
        }
    }
}
```
This provides a flexible pattern where __services are matched to message types__ through trait implementations and static dispatch. No dynamic routing or introspection is used â€” behavior is known at compile time.

### Static Composition, Dynamic Coordination
While all services and components are statically bound into the final binary:
- __Message routing and task polling occur dynamically__
- __Controllers only receive messages for devices they were registered to manage__
- __Multiple services can be registered independently and coexist without conflict__

This pattern supports:
- Easy testing with mocks or alternate HALs
- Additive subsystem design (battery, charger, thermal)
- Isolated debugging of service behavior
