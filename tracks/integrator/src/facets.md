| Facet | Role/Responsibility |
|-------|---------------------|

| EC Runtime Integration | Connect EC Services to HAL and mock/live backends |
| Update + Bootflow | ENsure Patina and EC stay in sync across restarts |        
| Test Infrastructure | Run Integration Test suites, validate behaviors |
| Security/Compliance | Validate signature chain, FF-A flows, runtime policies |
