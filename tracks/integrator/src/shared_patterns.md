## Comparison of Patina vs EC Integration Concerns
| Concern | Patina | EC |
|---------|--------|----|
| ✅ Component Registration | Static via `.with_component()` chaining | Static via `init()` + `register()` |
| ✅ Execution Model | EFI boot entrypoint | `embassy` async executor |
| ✅ Dependency Injection | Function-level parameters | Struct-wrapped traits |
| ✅ Component Lifetime Management | Core-managed | Controller-managed |
| ✅ Unit test support | Host-driven tests (mocked context) | Host-driven tests (mocked HALs) |
| ✅ Integration Testing | Possible via QEMU or structured test harness | Async harness + host logging
